\usage{
\method{subset}{egor}(x, subset, ..., unit = c("ego", "alter", "aatie"))

\method{[}{egor}(x, i, j, unit = c("ego", "alter", "aatie"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{\link[=egor]{egor()}} object.}

\item{subset}{either an expression evaluated on each of the rows of
\code{\link[=egor]{egor()}} (as in the eponymous argument of \code{\link[=subset]{subset()}}) or a
function whose first argument is a row, specifying which egos,
alters, or alter-alter ties to keep; output format depends on
\code{unit}: \describe{

\item{\code{"ego"}}{a single logical value specifying whether the ego
should be kept.}

\item{\code{"alter"}}{either an integer vector of indices specifying
which alters to select or a logical vector of length \code{nrow(x)}
specifying which alters should be kept.}

\item{\code{"aatie"}}{either an integer vector of indices specifying
which alter-alter ties to select or a logical vector of length
\code{nrow(x)} specifying which alter-alter ties should be kept.}

}
the expressions can access variables in the calling environment;
columns of \code{\link[=egor]{egor()}} as variables (which mask the variables in the
calling environment), as well as the following "virtual" columns to simplify indexing:
\describe{

\item{Ego index \code{.egoRow}}{ contains the index (counting from 1) of the row being
evaluated. (This can be used to access vector variables in the
calling environment.)}

\item{Alter index \code{.altRow}}{ contains the index (counting from 1) of the row number in the alter table.}

\item{Alter--alter indices \code{.srcRow} and \code{.tgtRow}}{ contain the
index (counting from 1) of the row of the alter being refereced by
\code{.srcID} and \code{.tgtID}. (This can be used to quickly access the
attributes of the alters in question.)}

}}

\item{...}{extra arguments to \code{subset} if \code{subset} is a function; otherwise unused.}

\item{unit}{a selector of the unit of analysis being affected: the
egos, the alters or the (alter-alter) ties. Note that only one
type of unit can be affected at a time.}

\item{i}{depends on \code{unit}: \describe{

\item{\code{"ego"}}{either an integer vector of indices specifying
which egos to select or a logical vector of length \code{nrow(x)}
specifying which rows should be kept; a logical list of length
\code{nrow(x)} is acceptable as well.}

\item{\code{"alter"}}{a ragged array (a \code{\link[=list]{list()}}) of length \code{nrow(x)},
either of integer vectors of indices specifying which alters to
select for the corresponding ego or of logical vectors of length
\code{nrow(x$.alts[k,,drop=FALSE])} specifying which alters should be kept.}

\item{\code{"aatie"}}{a ragged array (a \code{\link[=list]{list()}}) of length \code{nrow(x)},
either of integer vectors of indices specifying which alter-alter
ties to select for the corresponding ego or of logical vectors of
length \code{nrow(x$.aaties[k,,drop=FALSE])} specifying which ties
should be kept}

}

In general, constructing selection arrays for alters and ties is
complicated and error-prone, so the use of \code{\link[=subset]{subset()}} is
recommended.}

\item{j}{either an integer vector specifying which columns of the
filtered structure (ego, alters, or ties) to select, or a
logical vector specifying which columns to keep.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link[=egor]{egor()}} object.
}
\description{
Functions to index and take subsets of \code{\link[=egor]{egor()}} objects: manipulate
egos, alters, or alter-alter ties.
}
\details{
Removing or duplicating an ego will also remove or duplicate their
alters and ties.
}
\examples{

# Generate a small sample dataset
(e <- make_egor(5,4))

# First three egos in the dataset
e[1:3,]

# Similarly with subset()
subset(e, .egoRow <= 3)

# Using an external vector
# (though normally, we would use e[.keep,] here)
.keep <- rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), length.out=nrow(e))
subset(e, .keep[.egoRow])
# a more robust version of the above: pass a function of row and
# keep (which is passed as an additional argument to the function):
subset(e, function(r, keep) keep[r$.egoRow], .keep)

# Only keep egos with exactly three alters
subset(e, nrow(.alts)==3)

# Only keep egos with exactly two female alters
subset(e, sum(.alts$sex=="w")==2)

# Only keep female alters
subset(e, .alts$sex=="w", unit="alter")

# Only keep alters of a different sex form ego
subset(e, sex != .alts$sex, unit="alter")

# Only keep homophilous alter-alter ties
subset(e, .alts$sex[.aaties$.srcRow] ==
          .alts$sex[.aaties$.tgtRow],
       unit="aatie")
